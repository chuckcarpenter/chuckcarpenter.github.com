          <section class="content"><p>I‘ve decided that a portfolio showcase of my past work is no longer relevant, here’s&nbsp;why.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>So after many years in this internet game and sitting on a way outdated ‘portfolio’ site, I decided that I was ready to start over and evaluate that need&nbsp;again. </p>
<p>Was I going to put together something else with some static images of sites I&#39;ve worked on in various capacities, showcasing work that may not even be immediately obvious in that medium? It seemed just a bit too abstract and pointless as to what I do on a regular basis. Also, it frankly seems somewhat patronizing to those who do work on more visual product. Sure, sometimes I affect the look and feel of the projects I work on. Often, this is not the case, where I instead solve how it operates or&nbsp;performs. </p>
<p>Therein lies what you see now. What is currently a simple weblog. I plan to write some about industry happenings, changes and opinions in that subject matter. I would also like to do some experimentation with this site. I&#39;ll add small bits such as a basic <span class="caps">CV</span>, mostly to work with an interesting API or two. I think between what I hope this site becomes and my <a href="http://github.com/chuckcarpenter">GitHub</a> profile, most people should get a sense of the kind of work I can&nbsp;perform. </p>
<p>For this site, I&#39;m selecting <a href="http://pelican.notmyidea.org/">Pelican</a>. It‘s a static site generator. For smaller and more simplistic sites with a single author I just don’t see the point in getting involved with a <span class="caps">CMS</span>. Plus, it‘s in Python and that’s slowly becoming another language I&#39;d like to get better at/be more familiar with. Should be an interesting&nbsp;ride…</p>
